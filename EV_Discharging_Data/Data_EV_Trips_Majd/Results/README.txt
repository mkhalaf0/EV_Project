- The Average speed and the distance was extracted from the images of both the GPS app and the Apple Watch. [python]
- The Temperature was extracted separately. [python]
- Some of the temperatures were not provided in the images.
- The Elevation gain was extracted from the apple watch images. [Python]
- The data of the Distance and the speed of both methods were plotted and compared. [Found in the Results folder]
- The "too long data" were filtered and the corrected data (speed and distance) were provided. [Python to filter] [Filtered Data found in the results folder]

- The elevation gain/loss calculated using gpx files and the https://www.gpsvisualizer.com/profile_input; I used it to get images of elevation graphs that contains the gain and the losses; [Python] [elevation gain threshold =2.2 (closest one to the apple watch)]

[The Full Dataset is available in the Results Section]
Future:
- The Energy extracted from the images and appended to the full dataset.
